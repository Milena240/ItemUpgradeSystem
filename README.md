# ðŸŽ® Item Upgrade System  

A simple program that generates random items (Knife, Gun, Stone, Iron Sword) based on user input, assigning them a rarity. The program then upgrades **only common rarity items** once, allowing users to check the upgrade functionality.

## ðŸ”¥ Features
- Users input the **number of each item** (Knife, Gun, Stone, Iron Sword).
- Items are **randomly generated** with different rarities.
- Rarity types:  
  - **Common**
  - **Great**
  - **Rare**
  - **Epic**
  - **Legendary**
- Only **common rarity items** get upgraded **once** (for testing).

## Example output

How many Guns do you want to have? 20
How many Knives do you want to have? 30
How many Iron Swords do you want to have? 40
